# OpenTitan Governance

OpenTitan is a collaborative hardware and software development program with contributors from many organizations.
This area gives some more information about how the project is organized.

## Governance

OpenTitan is stewarded by [lowRISC CIC](./lowRISC.md), a not-for-profit company that uses collaborative engineering to develop and maintain open source silicon designs and tools for the long term.
As a lowRISC CIC Chartered Project, OpenTitan governance is handled via the [OpenTitan Charter](https://static.opentitan.org/technical-charter.pdf).

As described in full detail in the [OpenTitan Charter](https://static.opentitan.org/technical-charter.pdf), the governance structure consists of:
* The [Governing Board](./governing_board.md), responsible for project oversight and agreeing the technical roadmap.
* The [Technical Committee](./tech_committee.md), responsible for technical decision making required to implement the technical roadmap.
* [Working Groups](./working_group.md) allow specialists in the relevant area to work together in proposing technical decisions relevant to that workstream and function under the overview of the OpenTitan Technical Committee.

## Initiating new development

The [OpenTitan RFC process](./rfc_process.md) guides developers on how to initiate new development within the program.

## Contributing

See our documentation on [Contributing to OpenTitan](../contributing/README.md) (and the more in-depth [Detailed Contribution Guide](../contributing/detailed_contribution_guide/README.md)) for general guidance on how we work, making bug reports, dealing with security issues, and contributing code.

## Committers

Committers are individuals with repository write access.
Everyone is able and encouraged to contribute and to help with code review, but committers are responsible for the final approval and merge of contributions.
See the [Committers](./committers.md) definition and role description for more information.
