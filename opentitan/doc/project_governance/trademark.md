# OpenTitan Trademark

OpenTitan(R) is a registered trademark owned by lowRISC CIC.

The OpenTitan project restricts use of the OpenTitan trademark to its members, and only on certain conditions that guarantee the conformance and overall quality of the implementation.

These conditions are agreed and verified on an individual basis at the moment, but as the number of tapeouts of chips based on OpenTitan increases this page will be updated with generic guidance.
