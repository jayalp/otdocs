# OpenTitan user accounts

## Project Participants

Within the OpenTitan project there are two types of **Project Participants**

- **Partner Individuals** are individuals working for a Project Partner and designated by that Partner.
- **Individual Collaborators** are individuals who are not working for a Project Partner, who support the aims of the OpenTitan Project and wish to make a contribution to it.

All contributions to the project are under the terms of the [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/lowRISC/opentitan/blob/master/CLA) (CLA).

### Partner Individuals

Partner Individual refers to an individual who is working for an OpenTitan Project Partner and has been designated by that Project Partner as part of its contribution to the OpenTitan project.

Partners may identify individuals as Partner Individuals by requesting an OpenTitan account (see below).  
A number of OpenTitan accounts are available according to the Partnership Tier.   
By identifying an individual as a Partner Individual, the Partner authorises them to agree to the terms in the OpenTitan CLA when making contributions.

*lowRISC reserves the right to refuse, or revoke, Partner Individual status to any individual where, in the opinion of lowRISC C.I.C. (following consultation with the respective Project Partner),* 
*the actions, inactions, conduct or connections of the Partner Individual have harmed or risk harming the perception or reputation of lowRISC, the OpenTitan Project and/or any Project Partner.*

If a Partner Individual leaves the employment of a Project Partner, the Project Partner must notify lowRISC C.I.C. promptly so that they can be removed from relevant domains.  

### Individual Contributors

Individual Collaborators are individuals who wish to make a significant contribution to the OpenTitan project, either on their own or as part of a team.  

Individuals should be proposed by lowRISC or a Project Partner and approved by the Governing Board.

*The decision on admission shall be made in the best interests of the Project as a whole and in keeping with lowRISC's and the Project's open source mission.*
*Any decision not to admit a person must be based on objective factors (such as legal or reputational risk to the Project, non-compliance with laws, costs, or scalability)* 
*and not discrimination against the individual or any institution associated with them.*

*lowRISC reserves the right to refuse, or revoke, Individual Collaborator status to any individual where, in the opinion of lowRISC C.I.C. (following consultation with the Governing Board),* 
*the actions, inactions, conduct or connections of the Individual Collaborator have harmed or risk harming the perception or reputation of lowRISC, the OpenTitan Project and/or any Project Partner.*

The Individual Collaborator role is open to:
- Individuals not currently associated with a company or other institution (eg a University).
- Individuals associated with a company or other institution that is not an OpenTitan partner.

An individual can be 'associated with' a company or other institution by being an employee, consultant or director of the institution, or because they are primarily funded by an institution.
If associated with a company or other institution, there will be a requirement for that company to sign an **Organisational CLA** which authorises the individual to agree to the terms in the OpenTitan CLA when making contributions.

## OpenTitan accounts
OpenTitan accounts are required for most OpenTitan activity.
This includes:
- **Contribution**.  Only OpenTitan accounts can be used to contribute code on GitHub
- **Mailing Lists**.  Only OpenTitan accounts can be used on mailing lists
- **Groups**.  Governing Board, Technical Committee and Working Group memberships can only use OpenTitan accounts

### Requesting an account
User accounts are available through [partner membership](./partnership.md).
Accounts are requested from get-involved@opentitan.org
If you have more people wishing to get involved than the free entitlement from your partner membership, further user accounts can be purchased. 

The limit on OpenTitan accounts according to your partnership level is applied to **open** accounts.  
If an account is not needed, it can be closed by contacting get-involved@opentitan.org and the account entitlement reused.

### Using an OpenTitan account
All communications using your OpenTitan account are as part of the OpenTitan community.
Please be aware of, and comply with, the [code of conduct](./code_of_conduct.md)

The OpenTitan account is intended for managing communications within OpenTitan.
The associated storage ("OpenTitan workspaces") are not intended for long-term storage:
- OpenTitan workspaces should not be used as general storage space to store non-OpenTitan material
- Company confidential material and non-OpenTitan IP should not be stored in OpenTitan workspaces
- lowRISC, as stewards of OpenTitan, are not responsible for management and backup of OpenTitan workspaces.
- If OpenTitan accounts are closed, associated workspace data is deleted

### Maintenance of OpenTitan accounts
If you no longer need your OpenTitan account, please notify get-involved@opentitan.org and the account can be closed.

If an OpenTitan account is not being used, it will eventually be closed, following the process below:
- OpenTitan account usage will be monitored quarterly
- Using an account is considered any of the following:
  - Signing in to the account
  - Sending a slack message
  - Any GitHub activity using the account
- If an account has not been used for **6 months** it is considered **inactive**   
- If an account is **inactive** the owner will be sent a warning that the account may be deleted
- If there is no response and the account remains **inactive** the account will be **closed** after **one month**
- When this happens, all data is deleted, with no backup maintained
